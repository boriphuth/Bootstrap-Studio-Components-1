# Bootstrap-Studio-Components
I'll save some of my creations for Bootstrap Studio in here

##QueNua.Togglable.Tabs
Togglable tabs base on the Bootstrap documentation exemple.

The bscomp file is absent, seem that Studio won't pick up some css rules width the ~ (tidle).

Hope this will be fixed at some point.
